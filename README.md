# Email_Spam_Classification using Naive Bayes

This project is a machine learning solution that classifies emails as "spam" or "not spam" using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Designed to assist in filtering out unwanted or malicious emails, the model analyzes email text to detect patterns commonly associated with spam messages. This repository includes all code, documentation, and sample data for training and testing the model.


Key Features:


Efficient Spam Classification: Uses Naive Bayes classifier for accurate and fast email spam detection.

Text Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of email text for optimal model performance.

Performance Evaluation: Detailed evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess model effectiveness.

User-Friendly Structure: Clearly organized codebase and documentation to easily understand and run the project.

Technologies Used

Python: For building the machine learning model and preprocessing text data.

Scikit-Learn: To implement the Naive Bayes algorithm and evaluate the model.

Jupyter Notebook: To present code, explanations, and visualizations in an interactive format.

Project Objective:


The objective of this project is to build a robust, lightweight spam classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm, which can serve as a foundational approach for implementing spam filters. By analyzing various characteristics of email content, this model aims to reliably distinguish between legitimate emails and spam, reducing inbox clutter and enhancing email security.
